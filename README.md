**Problem Statement**
In today's digital age, people have access to a wide variety of books through libraries and online stores. However, the cost of buying new books or the environmental impact of mass production can be a barrier for many readers. There is a growing need for a platform that enables users to exchange books in a community-driven way, promoting both sustainability and cost-efficiency.

A Book Exchange Platform allows users to list their books for trade, request books they want, and exchange books within a community. This platform will be a web-based application that enables users to:

Register and authenticate themselves.
List books they want to exchange.
Search for available books and request a book they need.
Manage book exchange requests.

**Solution Overview**
The Book Exchange Platform will be built as a RESTful API using Node.js and Express. The backend will handle user registration, book listing, search, and the management of book exchange requests.

Here's an outline of the key features of the solution:

User Registration and Authentication:
Users can sign up with their email and password.
JWT (JSON Web Token) will be used for user authentication.

Book Management:
Users can add, update, and delete books they wish to exchange.
Users can search for available books by title, author, or category.

Book Exchange Requests:
Users can request a book that is available on the platform.
When a book is requested, a pending exchange request will be created.

Book Availability Management:
Once the exchange is completed, users can mark the book as exchanged, removing it from the list.
Solution Architecture

Database:
MongoDB (NoSQL) to store user and book data.

Authentication:
JWT (JSON Web Token) for secure user login and session management.

API Framework:
Node.js with Express.js for building the RESTful API.
